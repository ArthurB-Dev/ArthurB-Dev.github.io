Hi, I’m Arthur!

I’m a first-year Aerospace Engineering student at Swansea University, and this blog is my way of sharing the journey as I attempt to learn and (sometimes) struggle through the world of engineering.

### What You’ll Find Here

The idea of this blog is planned to be a mix of:

- University studies – My notes, reflections, and simplified breakdowns of the topics I’m learning. Think of it as “engineering concepts explained by a student who doesn't really get it.”

 - Personal projects – I love building and experimenting outside of uni, so I’ll be documenting my side projects (from rockets to drones to coding simulations).

 - Engineering insights – Occasional posts about aerospace history, current innovations, and anything I stumble across that I find interesting.

 - Life – Sometimes I’ll also share a bit about my experiences outside the classroom, like working at summer camp, learning new skills, and figuring out how to balance everything.

### Why I’m Writing This

 - To learn better – During my revision for my exams in my foundation year I found that explaining the concepts I was revising to my pet bird really helped solidify the concepts in my head. Unfortunatly little Albie my Cockatiel passed on Easter Sunday of this year so without my study buddie I need to find new ways to work.

 - To document my journey – I want to look back at the end of my degree and see how far I’ve come because I feel like even just in this past year (my foundation year) I have come so far already.

To share with others – Whether you’re another student, someone curious about aerospace, or just passing by, I hope you’ll find something useful or inspiring here.


### What’s Next

I’ll be posting regularly (aiming for twice a month to start - this being optimistic) with updates on what I’m learning and working on. If you’re interested in aerospace, engineering, or just following along with the journey, stick around!

Thanks for being here - let’s see where this goes.

– Arthur
