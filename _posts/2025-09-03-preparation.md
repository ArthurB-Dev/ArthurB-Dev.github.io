## Move it move it

Today marked day two of my Uni prep. I move into my new house on the 6th so I have begun repacking all of my things, thankfull I hadn't necessarily unpacked since I had travelled to Canada to work for 9 weeks almost straight after I moved back home. Since I have only had 2 weeks post Canada at home my entire life is either shut away under a pile of other boxes or in a suit case.

> I've just spent 20 minutes thinking about the type of 4 dimensional structure that would be needed to have a system where all boxes have at least on other box on them.

### Boxes, a totally unnecessary tangent

In fact, just on this; my first thought was the idea that the boxes are simply in a circle where each box is slightly angled so that a 360 degree rotation of boxes can occure however that would mean boxes more than 90 degrees and less than 180 degrees from the starting spot would not count as being on top of the one next to it. This means the box at the bottom of the circle is therefore (somewhat obviously) under all other boxes and the box at the top (although its lid and base are both touching box) technically would rest on both boxes its adjacent too - This is assuming that the number of boxes and the potition of the boxes allows for one box to be at the peak and trough of the circle, although this is somewhat of an unimportant aspect.

## Oh OneNote you sweet angel, how I hate you so

One note and I have an incredibly beutiful love hate relationship where it hates me and I have to deal with that fact. The love part comes from the fact I get it for free from Swansea. Sometimes its these free things from the Uni that make the Tesco meal deal price increases hurt slightly less. Today it was my mission to setup my new notebook ready for next years course.

Im rather proud of my achievement, we have nice set of sections neatly organised into groups. Each section is a subject and inside of it we have a course details page which includes improtant course info.

Notice the link to a master excel sheet. This has my entire years plan inside as one document including my revision plans, timetable, course information, and more. I would talk about it but its all really just copied from other places into one master so I can quickly access info without scouring through folders of folders of stuff.

### Folders

Folders you say? I have them! One folder for each module to be exact, and within each is four folders:

- Assignments - For the assignments I write
- External Content - For content I find that I need to keep with that module
- Sent Content - For content sent by the lecture or provided by the uni
- Lecture Slides - The lecture slides

### So what?

This is the most Dull Men's Club type thing I ever get excited about but especially in the lead up to doing some propper Uni work this gets me super hyped. That's all from me.
