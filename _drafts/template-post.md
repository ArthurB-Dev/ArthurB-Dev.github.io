What You Could Write About
1. University Life & Studies

Course topics explained simply – After lectures, write posts explaining concepts (e.g., “What is vector equilibrium?” or “Introduction to Bernoulli’s equation”). This helps you revise and also demonstrates your understanding.

Study reflections – Weekly/monthly roundups of what you’ve learned, what you found hard, and how you overcame it.

Project breakdowns – When you do lab reports, design tasks, or group projects, write them up in plain English with diagrams/photos.

Exam revision guides – Share tips, summaries, and formulas you use.

2. Personal Engineering Projects

Build logs for any side projects (e.g., model rockets, drone modifications, 3D printing, coding simulations).

Tutorials or “how I built this” guides, with photos and lessons learned.

Progress journals: even if unfinished, document process over perfection.

3. Aerospace & Engineering Interests

Posts on aerospace history (“How Concorde pushed engineering limits”).

Industry trends (“Electric planes: where are we really at?”).

Summaries of interesting papers, documentaries, or books you read.

Thought pieces on space exploration, sustainable aviation, or new technologies.

4. Personal Growth & Skills

Time management strategies as a first-year engineering student.

Coding in MATLAB/Python for aerospace.

CAD learning journey (SolidWorks, Fusion 360, CATIA).

Reflections on failures and lessons learned (these posts can be very relatable).

5. Summer Experiences / Work

Document your camp experience (especially since you’re running archery sessions—you can link this to mechanics and physics!).

Future internships, placements, or networking events.

How non-engineering work (like camp) still builds transferable skills.

🔹 How to Structure the Blog

Since you can use folders + tags, you don’t need many static pages (just an “About Me” page and maybe a “Start Here” page). Everything else can be posts.

Suggested folder structure:

University

Year 1, Year 2, etc. (so readers can follow your progression)

Within each year: Lectures, Projects, Reflections

Personal Projects

Rockets, drones, CAD builds, coding, etc.

Aerospace Insights

Industry, history, news, book/paper reviews

Skills & Tools

CAD, coding, study skills, productivity

Life & Experiences

Summer camp, personal growth, random reflections

Tagging strategy:

Use tags to cut across folders (e.g., “fluid dynamics,” “time management,” “Python,” “spaceflight”).

This way, someone can find all posts related to “Python” whether they’re from uni or projects.

🔹 Guidelines for Writing & Running the Blog
Writing Style

Audience: Think of readers as future students, curious outsiders, or recruiters. Write simply but accurately.

Tone: Conversational, reflective, but with a technical edge.

Clarity: Use diagrams, sketches, and photos whenever possible.

Length: Mix short posts (~500 words, quick reflections) and long-form guides (~1500+ words).

Workflow

Keep a “drafts” folder: jot down quick ideas right after lectures/projects before you forget.

Aim for consistency over volume – e.g., one post a week or biweekly.

Use revision posts before exams to summarise topics (these double as study notes!).

Keep each post focused on one topic—don’t cram everything.

Sustainability

Remember this is for you first. Don’t stress about views; treat it like your open notebook.

Use it as a portfolio—link it on LinkedIn/CV later.

You don’t need to be “original”—your take on something is valuable.

If stuck, write “what I learned this week” posts—easy, repeatable.

🔹 Ideas for Your First Few Posts

Introduction Post – Who you are, why you’re blogging, what readers can expect.

Why Aerospace Engineering? – Your motivation and what excites you.

First Month Reflections – What surprised you, what you found hardest.

Explaining a Fresh Topic – Pick one concept you just learned (e.g., Newton’s laws in engineering context) and explain it in your words.

Personal Project Showcase – Even if small, document something hands-on.

Book/Video Review – Write about a documentary or book that got you thinking about aerospace.

Camp Skills & Engineering Link – (e.g., “What Archery Taught Me About Physics and Focus”).

✅ By doing this, your blog will naturally grow into:

A revision tool (study notes in blog form)

A portfolio (showing your projects/skills)

A personal diary (documenting your growth as an engineer)
